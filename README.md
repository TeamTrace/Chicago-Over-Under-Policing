# Chicago Over-Policing, Under-Policing Analysis

The Trace used data from the Chicago Police department and other sources to examine trends in gun violence, clearance rates, and proactive policing. This repository includes the data, methodology, documentation, and code for that analysis. The findings were used in the story, [“Most Shooters Go Free in Chicago’s Most Violent Neighborhoods — While Police Make Non-Stop Drug Arrests”](), published on November 12, 2019.

The story was done in partnership with WTTW, for its digital documentary series, "WTTW Firsthand: Gun Violence.” The 15-episode series chronicles what Chicagoans are doing every day to fight for peace in their own communities. You can find the series, and The Trace’s other stories for the series, on [WTTW's project page]().

## Data Analysis

The data used for this analysis generally falls into three categories: Data available online, data that we obtained through public records requests, and manual categorizations that we created for the purpose of this analysis. The notebooks provide detail on each data source, important caveats, the code and methodology for the analysis, and the output of the analysis. Documentation, such as source notes, code tables, communication on public records requests, and reference materials, are included in the same folder as the relevant dataset(s). In some cases, Excel files contain additional source notes.

## Additional Stories and Resources

This story was done as part of The Trace’s ongoing reporting on law enforcement’s increasing failure to bring shooters to justice. You can read other stories in our “Free to Shoot Again” series [here](https://www.thetrace.org/category/free-to-shoot-again/).

The Trace and BuzzFeed News did a sweeping analysis of clearance rates for the stories, ["Shoot Someone In A Major US City, And Odds Are You’ll Get Away With It”](https://www.thetrace.org/features/murder-solve-rate-gun-violence-baltimore-shootings/) and ["5 Things To Know About Cities’ Failure To Arrest Shooters"](https://www.thetrace.org/2019/01/gun-murder-solve-rate-understaffed-police-data-analysis/). Both stories were published January 24, 2019. Our complete data, code, and methodology can be found on the project's [GitHub page](https://github.com/the-trace-and-buzzfeed-news/introduction).

In November, The Trace made available raw data containing incident-level records on 4.3 million murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults, obtained through public records requests to 56 police and sheriff departments. Most of the datasets include case status. The data can be downloaded [here](https://www.thetrace.org/violent-crime-data/).
